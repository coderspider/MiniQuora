# FLASK BOOK SHOPPE

## How should I use this template?

* Clone the folder or download the zip.
* Install requirements (flask, flask_materialize, flask_sqlalchemy,sql alchemy)
* In JSON path, use '/' if you are using linux operating system and '\' if you are using windows operating system. I'm not sure how macintosh handles path specifiers.
* Run book-shoppe.py as  "python book-shoppe.py" or "py book-shoppe.py" depending upon your python version. If you are unsure, you can check it by running command "python --version".

* For now, it can accept orders and add items to cart.
* Display a homepage with all items.
* Redirects to specific book page when clicked on book.
